# **Sales Analysis Project**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes sales data to extract meaningful insights that can drive business decisions. The analysis includes visualizations of sales trends, top-performing products, and location-based sales patterns. It is designed to demonstrate skills in Python, data analysis, and visualization.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessed raw sales data to handle missing values and format inconsistencies.
- **Top Products Analysis:** Identified top-selling products based on total revenue.
- **Category-Wise Analysis:** Visualized revenue trends across different product categories.
- **City-Wise Sales Insights:** Explored sales distribution by location.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for intuitive data representation.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries for generating insightful charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and visualization.

---

## **Dataset**
The project uses a sample sales dataset with the following columns:
- **Order ID:** Unique identifier for each order.
- **Date:** Order date.
- **SKU:** Stock-keeping unit of the product.
- **Category:** Product category.
- **Amount:** Sales revenue for the transaction.
- **Ship City:** Customer shipping city.
- ...and more.

---

## **Steps in the Project**
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and ensured uniform formatting.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed total sales across the dataset.
   - Grouped and visualized sales by product (SKU) and category.
4. **Visualizations:** 
   - Bar charts for top-selling products.
   - Line plots for sales trends over time.
   - City-wise sales distribution.

---

## **Key Insights**
- The top-selling product generated a revenue of â‚¹X,XXX,XXX.
- The "XYZ Category" had the highest sales volume across all regions.
- City "ABC" showed the highest number of transactions.
